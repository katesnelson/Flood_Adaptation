# Flood_Adaptation

This repo contains R scripts used for data cleaning and processing, spatial analysis, dasymetric interpolation, Bayesian modeling, and data presentation of work assessing the effectiveness of a home buyout program as a flood adaptation strategy. This work uses Nashville, TN as its case study area, and draws heavily from information from Nashville Metro Water Services (MWS) on the buyout program and the flood that occurred in 2010. Most data used is openly available online, however tax parcel information should be purchased from Nashville Metro Planning (those wishing to use the data for academic research should contact the Planning Office for potential reduced rates) and data on the buyout program, flood observations, and building footprints must be obtained privately from MWS and affiliated Metro offices. Data sources are noted within the scripts.
